## Project Thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to public opinion on policy issues in the United States. For instance, in a battleground state, what are the voting-eligible population's opinions on contentious issues such as abortion access, medicaid expansion or housing subsidy programs. 


## Research Question + Area of Study 

Do registered voters' support in Medicaid expansion in their state? More specifically, how do registered voters feel about Medicaid expansion in states that have yet to expand Medicaid? 

As I was looking at a data set from 2021 that was sponsored by he AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), the data is primarily focused on collecting response from registered voters' over the age of 50. Furthermore, the data set is more specialized as I am specifically looking at responses from registered voters over the age of 50 in South Carolina. My hypothesis is that voters over the age of 50 are more inclined to support Medicaid Expansion as they directly benefit from an increase in access to medical programs that are covered by their Medicaid insurance. The two variables I would be most concerned with are the respondent's age and their answer to Q4, from the AARP survey, about the importance of expanding Medicaid for low-income residents in South Carolina A positive result would show a strong correlation between respondents issuing their support for Medicaid expansion and their age as over 50. Additionally, this hypothesis could be further supported by respondents answers to questions about supporting programs for low-income households. If these respondents truly support the expansion of Medicaid they would show support for this program to assist low-income SC residents. On the other hand, my hypothesis would be disproved if despite their age, respondents did not show an overwhelming support for the expansion of Medicaid.
